One way to stay up-to-date with these trends is to engage with online communities such as Reddit. In this notebook, we'll use the Reddit API to collect data from three of the largest and most active subreddits focused on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence: `r/datascience`, `r/machinelearning`, and `r/artificial` and apply natural language processing techniques to extract insights from the top posts and their comments over the past few years. Through this project, we aim to gain a better understanding of current trends and sentiments in the data science community.  \n","By doing this, we hope to shed light on the attitudes and opinions of the community towards various topics.
